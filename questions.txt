Should Yolo rewuired data be put in the data file such as weights

is config file for yolo training hyperpoarameters as well. is anythign put here just for documentation purposes or is it retrieved by the program?

is the text file in each task for writing terminal output to it?



issues
detecting things in neutral images so need more neutral images with lots of noise
not not detecting large numbers on bricks so need more of those 
not classifying digits correctly so need more data
need to add data for alphabet probably need to make my own using photos of campus alphabets
